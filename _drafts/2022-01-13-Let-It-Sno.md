So... I planned this title a while back.  How ironic that, as I sit here, we are expecting at least of foot of real snow...

But, that's not what today's post is about.  Instead, we're going to make our own SNO.  That is, Single Node OpenShift.

This is also the first in a series of posts about my journey to build a multi-region, active/active/active, application with cloud-native practices and technologies.  Eventually we'll use the SNO as the control-plane for our cluster-of-clusters.

I am also introducing a major refactor of the helper scripts for this lab.  I find myself building and tearing down entire lab ecosystems often enough that I finally got tired of the relentless copy and paste required by the current layout of my lab tutorial.  Plus, this new project will require three complete clusters and the SNO.
