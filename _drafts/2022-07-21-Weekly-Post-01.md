So...   I have written a few applications over the course of my career in IT.  But, I've never been a "real" Software Engineer.  That is to say, I've never been a coder on an application development team.  You can likely tell from the content of this blog, that I am more of a platform guy than a developer.  As I made the transition from platform engineer to architect, the code that I wrote was mainly for prototyping and teaching.  But, I find that knowing the principles of software engineering and design as well as platforms and security has been a huge help in my various roles as an enterprise architect.

With that in mind, I am starting a new Blog series today.  This, (hopefully weekly), series will be focused on software engineering skills for architects who sometimes write code.

Plus, I'm a huge fan of the Quarkus Java Framework.  So, this is also an opportunity to share that with you too.  Check it out here: [https://quarkus.io](https://quarkus.io){:target="_blank"}  It's a Java framework for Kubernetes native apps.  If you are familiar with Spring Boot, you'll find a lot to like about Quarkus.

In this first post, we are going to create a REST API and client.

## Set Up Your Dev Environment

At a minimum, you are going to need the following:

1. Git CLI

1. An IDE, I will be using Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com){:target="_blank"}

1. Java - I'm using OpenJDK 17

1. The Quarkus CLI: [https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling){:target="_blank"}
