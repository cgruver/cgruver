This site is dedicated to sharing the work that I do in my home lab.  I am a huge fan of cloud native application delivery on Kubernetes based platforms.  I specifically focus on [OpenShift Container Platform](https://openshift.com), and its subscription free (community supported) sibling, [OKD](https://okd.io).

The projects that I present here are intended to reflect a "close to real-world" environment.  The result is a more complicated setup than you will find in other tutorials, but the trade off is that your lab environment will resemble what you find in most corporate IT environments.  I try to focus on what my brother-in-law commonly calls the "ilities" of IT; security, reliability, flexibility, availability, etc...

The anchor of this site is my OpenShift Home Lab setup instructions.

[Building a Portable Kubernetes Home Lab with OpenShift - OKD4](/home-lab/lab-intro/)

The links in the left hand navigation, (or drop down menu on mobile), will take you to specific tutorials for building or adding capabilities to your home lab.
