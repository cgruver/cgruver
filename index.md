This site is dedicated to sharing the work that I do in my home lab.  I am a huge fan of cloud native application delivery on Kubernetes based platforms.  I specifically focus on [OpenShift Container Platform](https://openshift.com), and its subscription free (community supported) sibling, [OKD](https://okd.io).

I have recently changed the format of this blog to be video centric.  Future posts will include "follow along" instructions that accompany a video explaining the exercise.

Because technology has changed so much since I started this blog, a lot of the older posts and lab tutorials are less relevant.  I am retaining them for reference, but no longer support some of the older hardware mentioned.

[Building a Portable Kubernetes Home Lab with OpenShift - OKD4](/home-lab/lab-intro/)

The links in the left hand navigation, (or drop down menu on mobile), will take you to specific tutorials for building or adding capabilities to your home lab.
