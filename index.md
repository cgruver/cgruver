This site is dedicated to sharing the work that I do in my home lab.  I am a huge fan of cloud native application delivery on Kubernetes based platforms.  I specifically focus on [OpenShift Container Platform](https://openshift.com), and its subscription free sibling, [OKD](https://okd.io).

The projects that I present here are intended to reflect a "close to real-world" environment.  The result is a more complicated setup than you will find in other tutorials, but the trade off is that your lab environment will resemble what you find in most corporate IT environments.  I try to focus on what my brother-in-law commonly calls the "ilities" of IT; security, reliability, flexibility, availability, etc...

There are three different ways to navigate this site:

1. The Blog posts below, which I add to about once a month.  They are a reflection of my current work, and often are dependent on previous posts.

1. The left hand navigation, (or drop down menu on mobile).  Those links will take you to specific tutorials for building or adding capabilities to your home lab.

1. The top navigation bar.  
   * [About Me](/about/): A brief bio
   * [Lab Projects](/lab-projects/): More descriptive info on the lab projects listed in the left hand nav bar.
   * [Videos](/videos/): YouTube links to videos that I have participated in.
