So...  It's Pi day...  I would be remiss if I did not give you a link to all of my Raspberry Pi pages...

[OpenWRT With a Slice of Pi](/home-lab/bastion-pi/)

[Sonatype Nexus, With a Slice of Pi](/home-lab/nexus-pi/)

[Gitea - "Git with a cup of tea"... and a slice of Pi](/home-lab/gitea-with-pi/)

Yeah...  that's a tired pun...  sorry about that.

Anyway, that's not why we are here today.

I have written an introduction to OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) with a tutorial.

I hope you enjoy it:
