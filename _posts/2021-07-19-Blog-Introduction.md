## Greetings, and Welcome to my world

Since my childhood, I've always been fascinated by miniaturized things.  N-Scale model trains, 1/72 scale model helicopters, Tonka trucks in my sandbox...  So, as I began my IT career, it was no surprise that this fascination continued with ulta portable laptops and netbooks.  I love things that are easy to pack up and take with you.

Technology is one of my many hobbies.  I write code and learn new things for fun and relaxation, which naturally led me to seek out ways to take my tech toys with me.
