Every software delivery shop needs a source code management system.  Git is the defacto standard these days for SCM, and there are a lot of server options out there.  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc...  are all really good choices.  But, since were using Open Source software for our lab, on a disconnected network, and using OpenWRT for our bastion host, I'm going to introduce you to a Git server that you may not have used before.

It's time for Tea.  Gitea, that is.  

[Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) is a free and open source self-hosted Git server.

So, this week we're going to set up a Git server for our lab.
