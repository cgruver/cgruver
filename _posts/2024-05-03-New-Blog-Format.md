Greetings!  

Apologies for the long period of silence.  Ironically, I've been too busy playing with my home lab to blog about my home lab...  Well... #DayJob did get in the way a bit too...  Oh, and my wife and I learned to sail.

So, since I've been spending a lot more time outside on a sailboat, I decided to take my home lab with me.  I also decided that it takes way too long to write one of these posts.  So, I'm changing that too.

Introducing `OpenShift Outdoors - The Video Blog`.

In this new format, I will be recording short(ish) videos about different topics in my home lab.  Some of the posts will also include text based instructions for you to follow along with.

Blog videos will be posted in my new YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@upstream-without-a-paddle](https://www.youtube.com/@upstream-without-a-paddle){:target="_blank"}

The first two videos are focused on OpenShift Dev Spaces and can be found at the following links:

* [Introduction to OpenShift Dev Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86S2ErWyorQ){:target="_blank"}

* [Deep Dive Into the `devfile` spec for a Dev Spaces workspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvbpDDhAgxM){:target="_blank"}

Stay tuned for new videos.

I hope you enjoy the new format.

Cheers.
