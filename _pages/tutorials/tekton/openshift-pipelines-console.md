## There's a Console Too

Let's pause from our CLI work for a moment and take a look at the OpenShift Web Console as it relates to Pipelines.

I know, I know...  

You really don't care about the GUI right?  

You're all in on the CLI.  

Never fear, we'll get back to the CLI soon enough...

;-)

We still haven't written any application code... compiled it...  or, deployed it.

That's kind of important for CI/CD.

We also need to put the `C` into CI/CD.

So, let's do that next.  Then we'll write some code!  I promise.
