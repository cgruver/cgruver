Greetings!

I am a Kubernetes junkie, and a home lab enthusiast.

I was trained as a theoretical physicist, but ended up as an IT professional...  20+ years later, I still love it.

Checkout my Projects on GitHub - (Some are still in development)

* [Main GitHub Projects Page](https://github.com/cgruver)
* [Opinionated Rewrite of erdemo.io, Demonstrating Quarkus, Kafka, Cassandra, and Tekton](https://github.com/cgruver-cajun-navy)

  This is a work in progress.  Actually, it is a work in pause...  I've been distracted by my home lab infra work.

* [Home Library Application, Demonstrating Quarkus, MariaDB Galera, Kafka, and Tekton](https://github.com/lab-monkeys)

  Also a work in pause...  I'll get back to it soon.
